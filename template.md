# Summary
One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation
Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Guide-level explanation
Explain the proposal as if you were teaching it to another programmer. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how programmers should *think* about the feature.. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.

# Reference-level explanation
This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks
Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?
